    Many cells takes a very long time to run, e.g. cross-validation, OvR, and KNN. It will take half an hour to 2 hours for a single cell to run.
    
    One negative feature of colab is, once you get disconnected, you have to run all the previous cells again which consumes significant amount of time.
